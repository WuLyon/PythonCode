# Question:

# Python has many built-in functions, and if you do not know how to use it,
# you can read document online or find some books.
# But Python has a built-in document function for every built-in functions.

# Please write a program to print some Python built-in functions documents,
# such as abs(), int(), raw_input()

# And add document for your own function Hints:
# The built-in document method is doc
def doc_test():
    '''
    This function is to test the __doc__ function
    '''
    print("This is doc_test()")


doc_test()
print(doc_test.__doc__)
